# Would You Rather Assignment

This is my completed project of the Udacity React Nanodegree Would You Rather project. This app has been built up from the original starter files. 

All of the React and Redux code has been added to allow users to interact with the simple polling game. Users can login as any of the assigned users and continue to answer set questions, view the current poll for existing questions, if they have already answered, ask new questions and review a leaderboard to see which user has the highest combined score of asked and answered questions.

## Installing the App

To launch this app clone all of the files in this directory, change to the root folder and use NPM to install.

Follow these steps:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fiolagan/would-you-rather-reactnd-assignment.git
